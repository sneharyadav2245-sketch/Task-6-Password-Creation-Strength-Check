## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1. Created Passwords with Varying Complexity

| Password Example            | Type          |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| `password123`               | Weak          |
| `Pass@2024`                 | Medium        |
| `!M3nT0r$2024#SecuR3`       | Strong        |
| `T#7n!9e@L$zQ%v*2025pX`     | Very Strong   |

---

### 2. Tested Passwords Using Online Tools

### 3. Results & Feedback

| Password             | Estimated Crack Time     | Tool Feedback                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `password123`        | < 1 second                | Very weak and common                      |
| `Pass@2024`          | A few minutes             | Weak and predictable                      |
| `!M3nT0r$2024#SecuR3`| > 10 billion years        | Excellent strength                        |
| `T#7n!9e@L$zQ%v*2025pX` | Trillions of years     | Extremely strong, high entropy            |

---

## ✅ Best Practices Learned

- Use **minimum 12-16 characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid using **dictionary words** or predictable sequences
- Prefer **passphrases** or **random combinations**
- Use a **password manager** to store secure passwords

## 🕵️‍♂️ Common Password Attack Techniques

| Attack Type        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**    | Tries all possible combinations of characters                               |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Tries known/common passwords or variations                               |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked credentials from data breaches                              |

## 🔒 Summary – Complexity vs Security

Password complexity significantly increases security. Simple passwords are easily cracked using automated tools. Complex, high-entropy passwords resist brute force and dictionary attacks and are essential in today’s threat landscape.
